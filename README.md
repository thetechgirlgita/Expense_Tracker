# Personal Expense Tracker

A new Flutter mini application.

In this application, we can find the mixture of widgets between widgets.
Like :
```
Column(
  children : [
    Container(
      child: Card(
        child: Text("Hello"),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```
Widgets and more widgets in every steps to create a new UI required Screen.
It is a best practice to track your expense for savings and knowing the needs.
